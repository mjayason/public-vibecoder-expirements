✨ **AI Experiments for Technological Literacy and Collaboration**

This repository hosts a growing set of experiments exploring how artificial intelligence can improve the way we **learn**, **collaborate**, and **build** with technology.

### 💡 Why “VibeCoder”?

Because code should feel intuitive, expressive, and in sync with how humans think and collaborate. These experiments aim to bring that "vibe" back to modern development—powered by AI.
