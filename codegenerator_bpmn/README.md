## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

Ensure you have:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed

Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install xmltodict openai
```

### 2. Open the Notebook

Start Jupyter and open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook codegenerator_bpmn.ipynb
```

### 3. Upload & Parse BPMN

- Use the notebook to load `ai_agent_quote_bind.bpmn`
- The notebook parses the BPMN XML into a structured format
- Generates code snippets or skeletons based on the task types

### 4. Review Generated Code

The generated output may include:

- Python class/function scaffolds
- Agent-oriented logic (QuoteAgent, BindAgent, etc.)
- Optional visualization of task flows (Mermaid / Graphviz)

## 💡 Example Use Case

The `ai_agent_quote_bind.bpmn` file models an automated interaction between a **Customer** and **Insurer**, mediated by AI agents for:

- Request intake
- Underwriting checks
- Quote generation
- Bind confirmation

---

## 🔧 Configuration (platform.yaml)

Use `platform.yaml` to define:

- Execution environments
- Agent endpoints
- Model options (e.g., OpenAI, Azure, Claude)

---

## 🧱 Planned Features

- [ ] Agent-based skill orchestration (e.g., with Semantic Kernel)
- [ ] Natural language generation for each BPMN task
- [ ] Integration with deployment targets (via `platform.yaml`)
- [ ] HTML or Markdown code documentation from BPMN
